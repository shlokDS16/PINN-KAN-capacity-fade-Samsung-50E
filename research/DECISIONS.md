### D001 Project folder and venue (2026-11-04, status: accepted)
- **Decision:** project lives in `C:\Users\Shlok\Downloads\PINN KAN battery paper` (own git repo,
  outside the DLM repo); venue Journal of Energy Storage (Elsevier), as Shlok set.
- **Alternatives and why they lost:** inside the DLM repo (mixes projects and their ledgers); inside
  the old battery Paper 2 folder (risks reuse of its retired framing).
- **Evidence:** task brief from the lead session, 2026-11-04.
- **Proposer / opponent / judge:** lead (Shlok's brief; no debate needed).
- **Re-open if:** Shlok names another folder.

### D002 Compute and access for the night of 4-5 Nov (2026-11-04, status: accepted)
- **Decision:** CPU only tonight unless Shlok says "GPU ok"; at most 3 agents at once (3.6 GB RAM
  available at 20:35); no Chrome automation (no browser connected); paywalled full texts listed for
  Shlok to save by hand.
- **Alternatives and why they lost:** short guarded GPU chunks (standing order of 27 Oct: no
  unattended GPU; the CRP-S07 session uses the GPU tonight; PINN+KAN SOH models are small enough for
  CPU); 5 agents (RAM too low; crash history with low free RAM on 17-18 Oct).
- **Evidence:** memories laptop-gpu-crashes, parallel-research-sessions; `nvidia-smi` at 20:30.
- **Proposer / opponent / judge:** lead; rule-driven.
- **Re-open if:** Shlok gives a GPU go-ahead, or RAM frees up.

### D003 Figure and table form follows the best JES exemplars (2026-11-04, status: accepted)
- **Decision:** add a figure-form stage: catalogue the figure and table forms of the strongest JES
  papers, debate the form of each of our figures against that catalogue, build from run files,
  render-check against the exemplars (CONTRACT.md section 6a).
- **Alternatives and why they lost:** default matplotlib forms chosen by the implementer (looks
  weaker than what JES prints); forms copied from one exemplar (may not fit our claims).
- **Evidence:** Shlok's instruction, 2026-11-04 evening.
- **Proposer / opponent / judge:** Shlok (author's instruction).
- **Re-open if:** never dropped; the forms themselves are debated per figure.

### D004 Overnight download whitelist and resumable manager (2026-11-04 21:40, status: accepted)
- **Decision:** `tools/resumable_download.py` (detached process; pid in data/logs/downloader.pid)
  downloads only ISU-ILCC small files + Q_interpolated, TJU (3 zips + impedance), HUST and XJTU,
  about 6 GB, one file at a time, resuming from the bytes on disk after every drop (curl -C -),
  waiting with backoff while offline, pausing 00:05-00:30, verifying size and checksum.
  Status: data/DOWNLOAD_STATUS.md. Everything else in data/DEFERRED_URLS.tsv (about 76 GB:
  BatteryLife processed 31 GB, Stanford dynamic 17 GB, ISU cycling 10 GB, Samsung 50E 10 GB, others)
  waits for the dataset decision.
- **Alternatives and why they lost:** download the whole 82 GB queue overnight (mobile data from
  about 23:00, and most of it may never be used); download nothing until the topic is fixed (loses
  the night; TJU/HUST/XJTU and ISU are likely needed by the leading candidates or as comparison
  with prior art); several parallel connections (memory: at most 4 connections; one file at a time
  resumes most reliably).
- **Evidence:** Shlok, 21:35: network fluctuating; downloads must resume from where they stopped.
- **Proposer / opponent / judge:** lead; rule-driven (no debate needed for logistics).
- **Re-open if:** the dataset decision needs Samsung 50E, Stanford, MIT or the ISU cycling files.
